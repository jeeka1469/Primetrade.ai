Heyo!
This is my simplified crypto trading bot built for the Binance Futures Testnet using the official Binance API.

Made it for the "Junior Python Developer – Crypto Trading Bot" task y’all shared.
Hope this little bot impresses you 

What It Can Do
Place MARKET & LIMIT orders on BTCUSDT (or any symbol honestly)
Supports both BUY and SELL orders
CLI that listens like a good bot and lets you place orders easily
Logs every move – requests, responses, errors, all that jazz
Built on Binance Testnet so we don’t cry over real money

Enter this on bashhhh to run
python cli.py --symbol [BTCUSDT] --side [BUY] --type [MARKET] --quantity [0.001]
